   queue: ranks by the OLDEST `lastCustomerMessageTick` among each card's
   awaiting channels (the smallest tick = the longest anyone's been
   waiting), ascending, so the single longest-waiting card sorts first.
   Cards with nothing currently awaiting sort to `Infinity` — they sink to
   the very bottom regardless of how "Last Updated"/"Start Date" would have
   placed them, since this view's whole point is surfacing what needs a
   reply, not everything open. Note this ranks by the CUSTOMER's own last-

   channels (UX Chat, UX Email, UX SMS, Social Support). Each row shows an
   icon matching its own label (not a single icon reused across every row),

   (see `sumInQueue` below), not an independently-randomized number.

/* ── Contact History card (home tab, below Performance/Productivity) ──
   A recent-customer-contacts summary — name, resolution status, an optional
   "Redial" action for voice contacts, a one-line case summary, case ID, and
   (right-aligned) the channel + how long ago it happened, plus the handle
   time. The base 5 rows (`CONTACT_HISTORY`) are from a screenshot of
   exactly this content, so those values are that screenshot's own data,
   not derived from any other part of the app. Composed entirely from
   existing lyra-ui atoms — `DashboardCard` for the card shell
   (`headerActions` holding this card's own `ContactHistoryDateFilterChip`
   — a separate, 3-option "Today / Last 48 Hours / Last 72 Hours"
   control, not the shared `DateFilterChip` the Performance/Productivity
   cards' headers use, since this card's range options and cumulative-
   window semantics are its own — see `ContactHistoryDateFilterValue`'s own
   doc comment for why), `Badge` (`shape="circle" dot`) + plain text for the
   status indicator (critical=red/Escalated, info=blue/In Progress,
   success=green/Resolved, neutral=gray/New), and a plain `Button
   variant="outline"` for "Redial" (reusing the same `PhoneOutgoing` icon
   `InteractionRowActions`' kebab menu already uses for its own "Redial"
   action, rather than inventing a second icon for the same meaning) — no
   hand-rolled badge/pill markup.

   Row set is driven by the selected date range (`buildContactHistoryByRange`):
   "Today" starts EMPTY on login — there's no real backend here to have
   loaded any actual prior-contact history from, so this app no longer
   pretends otherwise with hand-authored placeholder rows the way it used
   to (a `TODAY_CONTACT_HISTORY` fixture, since removed). "Today" instead
   fills in for real, as the agent actually works: "Unassign & Dismiss"ing
   a whole assignment (`handleDismissInteraction`, main component) is what
   counts as a completed contact in this demo, and appends a genuine
   `ContactHistoryEntry` (`buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry`) onto
   `dismissedContactHistory` state — the one truly live piece of this
   card's data. Dismissing does NOT change that entry's status, though: it
   logs at the same neutral "Resolved" default every hand-authored
   `CONTACT_HISTORY` row's own closed-the-loop case uses, never a forced
   "Closed"/read-only one — an earlier pass tried that and it conflated
   leaving an assignment (a LeftNav/UI action) with the assignment's own
   status (a real-world fact about the case); per explicit follow-up,
   dismissing must never itself decide or change that. "Last 48 Hours"
   adds the 5 hand-authored `CONTACT_HISTORY` rows on top of whatever's
   been dismissed so far; "Last 72 Hours" adds 5 more
   (`EXTENDED_CONTACT_HISTORY`) pulled from the shared customer "database"
   (`CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS`, the same fixture `OUTBOUND_CUSTOMERS` above
   already sources from) rather than inventing unrelated names. Each range
   is a strict superset of the one before it — today's own (dismissed)
   rows never disappear just because a wider range is selected. */

 *  `dismissedContactHistory` (newest first, same descending-recency order
 *  every other range's own rows already read in). Ending just ONE channel of
 *  a card that's still otherwise open (`handleDismissChannel`) does NOT call
 *  this — the interaction as a whole isn't actually over yet, so there's
 *  nothing to log.
 *
 *  This row's status reflects whatever was actually last assigned to this
 *  interaction's primary channel, NOT a hardcoded default: `statusLabel:
 *  interaction.channelStatuses?.[primaryChannel?.id] ?? "Resolved"` (falls
 *  back to "Resolved" — the same neutral default every hand-authored
 *  `CONTACT_HISTORY` row's own "closed the loop" case uses — only if the
 *  agent never actually touched the status popover this visit for that
 *  channel), `statusVariant` resolved from that label via
 *  `SESSION_STATUS_TO_CONTACT_HISTORY_VARIANT`. Per explicit request: an
 *  assignment that was left at, say, "Escalated" or "Pending" when
 *  dismissed should log — and later reopen — AT that status, not silently
 *  reset to "Resolved". This is still a different thing from the OLDER
 *  "force `closed: true`" mistake documented below: the primary channel's
 *  status can legitimately BE "Closed" (the agent closed the contact
 *  themselves before dismissing), but that's what they actually chose, not
 *  something this function invents on their behalf — `closed`/
 *  `ActiveInteraction.closed` (the read-only-reopen flag) is still left
 *  unset entirely regardless of what that status says, so reopening this row later
 *  (`handleReopenContactHistoryEntry`) behaves like any other normal,
 *  reply-able row (able to change status again, composer available) — no
 *  forced read-only banner, even for a "Closed"-status row. An earlier pass
 *  forced `statusLabel: "Closed"` AND `closed: true` together here; per
 *  explicit follow-up, leaving an assignment (a LeftNav/UI action) must not
 *  itself decide or invent that assignment's own status OR its read-only-
 *  ness — both of those are governed entirely by what the agent actually
 *  did (the status popover) before dismissing, not by the act of dismissing
 *  itself. `customerId` is only set when `interaction.id` actually matches a
 *  real `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` id shape (`"customer-N"`) — an interaction
 *  started from an agent/team/skill/quick-dial/redial contact has no real
 *  customer record behind it, and `ContactHistoryEntry.customerId`'s own doc
 *  comment is specific about what this field means. */

 *  channel that was previously set to "Closed" and then redialed at the same

/* ── CustomersListView ──
   Contacts list view populating the Dashboard tab row's "Customers" tab
   (`activeDeskTab === "customers"`, see the render branch below). Row
   data now comes from lyra-ui's own shared `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` fixture
   (`@nicecxone/lyra-ui/customers-data`, already imported above for the
   Outbound picker) instead of a hand-transcribed screenshot table, so
   this list view can't drift out of sync with lyra-ui's "customer
   database" — see create-new-customers-data.ts, which now carries
   firstName/lastName/group/firstPhone/emailAddress/address1/city/state/
   postalCode fields (added alongside its pre-existing id/name/customerId/
   channels/avatarClassName) specifically so this table has real columns
   to render.

   The UI itself is a direct, trimmed port of lyra-ui's own "Data
   Management" template (DataManagement.stories.tsx's
   `DataManagementTemplate`) — same state shape (`sortKey`/`sortDir`/
   `handleSort`/`dirFor`, `useColumnReorder`, `visibleCols`/
   `ColumnToggle`, `filterValues`/`filterDefs`, row-selection
   `Checkbox`es, real `currentPage`/`rowsPerPage`-driven pagination),
   same `columnConfig: Record<Key, {label, flex}>` shape (proportional
   `flex-[n]` ratios, no per-column `min-w-[…]` floor — that floor is
   what made the table wider than its container earlier), same render
   shape (`TableToolbar` → `Table` → `TableFooter`). Left out: the
   template's own `PageHeader`/`SidePanel`/`TabList`/grouping/auto-fit —
   this embeds inside `AgentNextGenPage`'s own PageHeader/tab row, which
   already cover that job, and grouping/auto-fit weren't asked for. */

/* ── InteractionTranscript ──
   The conversation-transcript body for an active interaction's detail page,
   shown below the page header — whose own `titleSuffix` slot holds the
   `ChannelToggle` row now, not a separate row beneath it (replaces the
   empty placeholder div that used to sit there — see the `activeInteraction`
   branch above). Shows
   one fixed mock conversation (Liam Davis ↔ John Smith) split across two
   fixed mock sessions (`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS`) for every active interaction
   rather than a real per-interaction transcript — this is a UI prototype of
   the transcript layout itself, not a case-data integration.

   Only shown as-is for SMS/WhatsApp (a chat-shaped channel) — `channelType`
   picks which content renders, matching the record header's own active
   `ChannelToggle` pill: Voice and Email are placeholders ("Coming Soon
   {Voice,Email} Content") rather than the same chat transcript, since a
   voice call's or an email thread's own content genuinely doesn't look like
   a chat log and hasn't been designed yet — showing the SMS mock underneath
   either would misrepresent it as done. `customerName` swaps in for every
   customer-sender message's hardcoded mock name/initials ("Liam Davis"/
   "LD") in the SMS/WhatsApp branch, so the transcript at least reads as
   this interaction's actual customer rather than always the same fixed
   mock person; falls back to "Liam Davis" when unset (e.g. no active
   interaction) so this still renders sensibly in isolation.

   Broken into sessions (each a `# <case id> · <date>` separator — see
   `TranscriptSessionSeparator` — followed by that session's own messages)
   rather than one flat message list, per explicit request: a single
   interaction can span more than one contact record (a follow-up thread
   days later, a callback), and each one needs its own separator that
   expands in place to a "Session Details" summary (`TranscriptSession
   Details`) without disturbing the others. Each separator is `sticky
   top-0`, so scrolling through a session keeps its separator pinned at the
   top until the next session's own separator reaches the top and takes
   over — plain CSS sticky-header stacking, no scroll listener — see that
   component's own doc comment for why source order alone is enough to get
   this behavior.

   Deliberately hand-built instead of composed from lyra-ui's
   `ConversationMessage`: that component's "agent" variant doesn't produce
   the white-bordered customer bubble the reference screenshot shows (no
   variant maps to that background), and its avatar sits beside the bubble
   rather than below it next to the tag row — both would require changing
   `ConversationMessage` itself, which is off the table for this feature
   ("do not update the components in lyra-ui until i say"). The removable
   Technical/Urgent/Billing pills still reuse `Tag` unmodified — it already
   supports `onRemove` plus the purple/critical/default variants used below,
   no lyra-ui changes needed there. */

/* Each `TranscriptSession` is one contact record within the interaction —
   the reference screenshot's "# CTX-20250722-08841 · July 22, 2025 ⌄"
   separator plus the "Session Details" panel it expands to (Contact ID /
   Date / Start / End / Channel / Skill / Agent / Status). A single
   interaction can span more than one session (a callback, a follow-up
   message thread days later, etc.) — grouping `TranscriptMessage[]` under
   a session rather than one flat list is what lets the transcript render a
   separator between each and let every one collapse/expand independently.
   Two mock sessions here (a closed first contact, then a shorter follow-up)
   are enough to demonstrate the separator-per-session + sticky-stacking
   behavior; still a UI prototype, not real per-interaction session data.
   Session info (this separator + its Session Details panel) is shown for
   every channel type — Voice/Email get their own sibling arrays just below
   (`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS_VOICE`/`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS_EMAIL`), each with an
   empty `messages: []` since neither channel has designed transcript
   content yet (a call recording/summary UI, an email thread UI) — the
   session separator and its expandable details still apply to a call or an
   email the same as they do to a chat, it's only the message-by-message
   body underneath that's still a placeholder. See `InteractionTranscript`'s
   per-session render below for where that placeholder actually shows. */
// Status → `Tag` variant for `TranscriptSessionSeparator`'s pill — a small,

// "Open" (every draw there is Resolved/Escalated/Pending), so it isn't
// actually the same vocabulary. `Tag` (pill shape), not `Badge` — per
// explicit request, matching the same pill-shaped tag treatment used
// elsewhere in this transcript (e.g. the applied message tags just above
// the composer). Falls back to "neutral" for any future
// `TranscriptSession.status` value not listed here, rather than throwing.
// Now covers every status the session-status popover offers (see

// agree), just resolved straight to the underlying CSS var instead of

// semantic roles and has no true purple, so a plain inline-styled dot (same
// small circle shape `Badge`'s own `dot` mode renders, just not routed

   two fields per row. Uses lyra-ui's own documented "Label Horizontal"
   pattern (`Input.stories.tsx`'s `LabelHorizontalWithSeparator` story: the
   real `Label` atom on the left, a plain `lyra-body-md text-lyra-fg-
   secondary` value span on the right, in one row) rather than `Input` —
   `Input` always stacks its label *above* the field, which read as a
   normal editable-looking form regardless of `readonly`, not the
   horizontal label/value row the reference screenshot shows. Same pattern
   minus that story's trailing `Separator` — explicitly no dividers between
   rows here, this card is one glanceable block, not a divided list. Two
   pairs per row via `.lyra-form-grid` (an existing lyra-tokens.css
   container-query family, not a bare Tailwind `grid-cols-2`) under a
   `lyra-form-grid-wrap` boundary, same mechanism `CustomerDetailTabContent`
   uses for its own 2-up field rows.

   Wrapped in the same neutral `rounded-lyra-md border border-lyra-border-
   subtle bg-lyra-bg-control-subtle` container CONTRIBUTING.md's "Composing
   panel body content" convention uses for a card-like block sitting inside

/* ── TranscriptSessionSeparator ──
   The "# CTX-... · <date>" pill row between sessions. `sticky top-0` (no
   extra plumbing needed — this relies on plain CSS sticky-header stacking:
   each separator is the first child of its own session block, in normal
   document flow as a sibling of the next session block below it, so as the
   transcript's own `overflow-y-auto` container scrolls, a separator sticks
   to the top for as long as its session's messages are still scrolling by,
   then gets pushed off-screen the instant the *next* session block's own
   top — and therefore its own separator — reaches the scroll container's
   top edge. That hand-off is the "then it replaces the other one" behavior
   from the request; no scroll listener or IntersectionObserver needed for
   it, just each separator being `sticky top-0` in source order.
   `bg-lyra-bg-surface-base` keeps messages scrolling underneath from
   showing through while it's pinned; `z-[1]` keeps it above them —
   deliberately *not* `z-10`: `CustomerInformationSidePanel` (the
   docked panel this transcript sits beside) renders at `z-[5]`
   (side-panel.tsx), and a sticky element's own `z-index` opens a new
   stacking context compared against siblings up the tree, not just against
   the messages scrolling directly beneath it — `z-10` was outranking that
   panel and painting the separator/expanded Session Details card over top
   of it once the panel had content past the fold (confirmed via
   screenshot). `z-[1]` is enough to clear plain in-flow message content
   (which has no z-index of its own) while staying under every panel in
   this file that intentionally layers above the transcript.

   The trailing gradient div is the same "soft fade instead of a hard edge"
   technique `InteractionComposer` uses for its own top edge (see that
   component's doc comment), mirrored: `position: sticky` already
   establishes a containing block for an absolutely-positioned descendant
   (same as `relative` would), so no extra wrapper is needed here. Placed
   at `-bottom-8` (outside this div's own box, extending down into the
   messages scrolling underneath) rather than as internal bottom padding,
   so it overlays whatever message content is passing directly beneath the
   separator instead of just adding empty space inside it. Gradient runs
   solid (matching this bar's own background) at the top down to
   transparent at the bottom — the reverse of the composer's direction,
   since here the solid edge is at the *top* of the fade band, not the
   bottom.

   Session Details' open/close is animated via @radix-ui/react-accordion
   directly (AccordionPrimitive.Root/Item/Content) rather than lyra-ui's
   own Accordion component — that component always renders its own trigger
   row (a full-width button with its own chevron) plus a border-b divider
   after every item, neither of which fits here: the real trigger is the
   "# CTX-..." pill button below, and this feature was explicitly built
   with no dividers. Reusing the bare Radix primitives keeps the actual
   animation mechanism identical to Accordion's though — same
   data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down data-[state=closed]:animate-
   accordion-up classes, same --radix-accordion-content-height CSS
   variable driving the height, same 200ms ease-in-out keyframes already
   defined in this app's own tailwind.config.js (added there so Tailwind
   picks up the classes Accordion itself needs) — just without Accordion's
   own trigger/divider markup along for the ride. Root is fully controlled
   off openSessionIds (InteractionTranscript's own state) via value; the
   pill button below drives that state directly and never touches Radix's
   own Trigger (not rendered here at all), so onValueChange is a no-op —
   it only exists to satisfy React's controlled-prop-without-a-change-
   handler warning.

   The status `Tag` (e.g. "Resolved") used to be plain decoration inside
   the same big toggle button as the rest of the pill. It's now its own
   `Popover` trigger, pulled out of that button into a sibling — clicking
   it opens a status list (`Menu`, `bare` since `Popover`'s own content
   wrapper already supplies the surface) instead of toggling Session
   Details, so the two actions (change status / expand details) don't
   fight over one click target. Picking "Closed" swaps that same popover's
   `content` to a confirm view instead of closing it (`statusMenuView`) —
   one Popover instance, two possible bodies, not a second nested Popover —
   matching the reference screenshots' "select Closed → a warning to
   confirm" flow. Once a session's status IS "Closed", the trigger is
   `disabled` (`isClosed` below): there's no way back in from here, matching
   "closed cannot be re-opened." All the actual status state (which session
   is "Closed" now, which popover/view is open) lives in
   `InteractionTranscript` (this component owns no state of its own) —
   same reasoning `sessionMessages`/`openSessionIds` already live one level
   up: every session's status is independent, and only one status popover
   should ever be open across the whole transcript at a time. */

  //    below. Also resets `isAtBottom` to `true` (as if they'd clicked
  //    "Scroll To Latest" themselves), so the customer's reply a couple
  //    seconds later keeps auto-scrolling right along with it too.
  //  - The simulated customer reply only scrolls if the agent was already
  //    caught up to the bottom (`isAtBottomRef.current`, read fresh rather
  //    than depended on — see that ref's own comment) — if they've scrolled
  //    up to read earlier messages, an incoming reply shouldn't yank them
  //    back down; it only self-resumes once they scroll back down
  //    themselves (`handleTranscriptScroll`) or click "Scroll To Latest".

   list for `QuickReplyVariableForm` to collect those, keyed by each
   field's own `key`, which must match a `{key}` token in `template`
   exactly (see `fillQuickReplyTemplate` below). Plain (non-`rich`) items

/* ── InteractionComposer ──
   The message-input bar fixed to the bottom of an active interaction's
   detail page — a sibling rendered right after `InteractionTranscript`
   rather than living inside it, so it's a `shrink-0` row in the same flex
   column instead of scrolling away with the transcript above it (which is
   the `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` element doing all the scrolling).

   Composed from existing lyra-ui exports (`Textarea`, `Button`,
   `ActionIconButton`) plus the two new `QuickReplyMenu`/
   `QuickReplyVariableForm` exports for the "/trigger" quick-reply picker
   (see the "Quick replies" data block above this component). The "Send ▾"
   control is hand-built from two adjacent `Button`s (rounded-r-none /
   rounded-l-none, a hairline divider between) since lyra-ui has no
   dedicated split-button component; same reasoning as everywhere else in
   this file that composes existing atoms rather than waiting on a new
   lyra-ui primitive.

   Quick-reply mechanics: typing `/` (`QUICK_REPLY_TRIGGER_CHAR` below —
   `/` rather than `#`, per explicit request: it's the near-universal
   chat-command convention, e.g. Slack/Discord/Front/Intercom/Zendesk,
   where `#` almost always means a hashtag/channel instead) followed by
   any run of word characters with the caret still immediately after them
   (`QUICK_REPLY_TRIGGER_PATTERN` below, re-tested against the text up to
   the caret on every keystroke) opens the menu, filtered to items whose
   `id`/`title` contains what's typed so far; the (existing, previously
   unwired) "Quick replies" toolbar button opens the same menu at the
   current caret with no filter instead, for agents who'd rather browse
   than type a shortcut from memory. `quickReplyTriggerStart` records
   where the inserted/replaced range begins — either the `/`'s own
   position (typed trigger) or the bare caret (toolbar button, nothing to
   replace, pure insert). The menu itself owns no keyboard state (see
   `QuickReplyMenu`'s own doc comment) — arrow keys/Enter/Escape are all
   handled by this component's `onKeyDown` on the `Textarea` itself, so
   the textarea never loses focus/caret position while browsing. Selecting
   a plain item inserts `template` immediately; selecting a `rich` one
   swaps the same on-screen spot to `QuickReplyVariableForm` instead of
   closing, so the agent can fill in its field(s) — see
   `fillQuickReplyTemplate`'s own doc comment for the bracketed-preview-
   vs-final-insert distinction — before either inserting or cancelling
   back out (Cancel closes the whole picker rather than returning to the
   list, same "start over from `/`" flow either way).

   `onSend` hands the typed text up to `handleSendMessage` (the main
   component, where `interactions`/`setInteractions` actually live — this
   component has no access to that state itself) — that's what pushes the
   message into the active interaction's `liveMessages` and schedules the
   simulated customer reply. This component still owns nothing but the
   input's own text (and now the quick-reply picker's transient state);
   it doesn't know or care what happens to a message once sent. */

   `Input` component itself (Input's own `readonly` mode still renders a
   bordered box, which isn't this shape at all — the horizontal/label-only
   look lives in this separate story pattern, composed from `Label` +
   `Separator`, both already lyra-ui exports). Avatar uses initials

 *  panel (`CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel`, rendered as a sibling at the
 *  call site) is open; clicking the already-open card's own row toggles it
 *  back closed instead of just re-selecting the same one, same convention
 *  `CustomersListView`'s own `onRowClick` uses for `CustomerRowInfoPanel`.
 *
 *  Scrolls in its OWN independent box (`flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-hidden`
 *  below, with the list itself `overflow-y-auto`) — not as part of the
 *  Customer Information panel's shared `PanelContent` scroll region.
 *  Briefly changed to the latter (single shared scroll + a `sticky`
 *  toolbar) while chasing what turned out to be a real bug one level up —
 *  `SidePanel`'s own docked/pinned branch was missing an `h-full` its
 *  full-screen branch already had, so nothing above this component ever
 *  had a genuinely definite height to bound against, no matter how this
 *  component itself was built. With that fixed at its actual source (see
 *  `CustomerInformationPanelBody`'s own outer wrapper comment), the
 *  original independent-scroll design works as intended again, and is
 *  worth keeping over the shared-scroll fallback: it's what lets
 *  `CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel` (rendered as this component's own
 *  sibling at the call site) overlay ON TOP of this list instead of
 *  pushing it down or inheriting an arbitrary, content-driven height that
 *  doesn't match the visible viewport.
 *
 *  Search/filter state is local (`useState` in here), not lifted to
 *  `AgentNextGenPage` — unlike `selectedIndex` (which has to survive this
 *  component unmounting, since the detail panel renders as its sibling),
 *  nothing outside this component ever needs to read or restore the
 *  toolbar's own state, so there's no reason to hoist it. `selectedIndex`
 *  itself always refers to a position in the full, unfiltered `entries`
 *  array (so `CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel`'s prev/next chevrons keep
 *  stepping through the customer's whole history, not just whatever's

/* ── CustomerDetailTabContent ──
   The "Detail" tab's field-editor form (per a reference screenshot of a
   legacy admin contact-edit page) — two collapsible `Accordion` sections,
   "General" and "Address", both open by default, each a responsive
   `.lyra-form-grid` of real lyra-ui field components (`Input`/`Select`/
   `Checkbox`/`DatePicker`), same "Accordion wrapping real editable fields"
   composition `FormTemplate`'s own "Placement Information" section already
   demonstrates (form-template.tsx) — not a hand-rolled bordered box imitating
   one. `lyra-form-grid-wrap` on the root establishes the container-query
   boundary `.lyra-form-grid` needs (see that class's own doc comment in
   lyra-tokens.css): each row is 2-up at this component's own full width,
   stepping down to a single column well before an `InteriorPanel`'s
   typical ~250–425px width would otherwise crowd two fields onto one line.

   Reference screenshot's field labels were all-caps ("CONTACT #", "FIRST
   NAME") — that's the *legacy* admin app's own styling, not something to
   replicate via CSS `text-transform` (CONTRIBUTING.md §17 already covers
   exactly this mistake). Labels here are typed in normal case and rendered
   through each field component's own built-in label, same as every other
   field in this panel/app.

   Fields with a real source reuse it instead of inventing a second,
   possibly-disagreeing value: "Contact #"/"Total Balance"/"Address
   1"/"City"/"State"/"Zip Code" come straight from `fields` (the same
   per-customer data `buildCustomerInfoFields` already computed for the
   Overview tab — see `getFieldValue` above), and "First Name"/"Last Name"
   split `customerName` the same way `buildCustomerInfoFields`'s own
   synthesized email does (`splitCustomerName`). Everything else in the
   reference screenshot (Original Contact #, Title, Department, Balance
   Due, Account Block, Group, Due Date, Address 2) has no real or
   synthesized source anywhere in this app's data, so those stay at the
   screenshot's own shown defaults (empty / "None" / unchecked-false where
   shown, "$0.00" for Balance Due specifically since it's a distinct
   "amount currently owed" concept from Total Balance, not just a repeat of
   it) — editable, uncontrolled-from-outside local state, same
   "self-contained, not wired to persistence" status as every other
   prototype form in this app (`FormTemplate` included). */

/* ── CustomerDirectoryPhoneRow ──
   One phone slot's worth of fields, its own little self-contained block —
   pulled out of `CustomerDirectoryTabContent` (rather than inlined in a
   `.map`) so each of the up to 10 rows below owns independent `useState`
   the normal way a component does, instead of ten parallel array-indexed
   state slots in the parent needing hand-rolled per-index update
   functions for every field. Same "Call Attempts Today/Total" read-only
   stat pair for every row (there's no live call-attempt tracking in this
   demo, same static-`0` status as `TrackedChannel.messageCount`
   elsewhere) — plain text, not `Metric`/`DashboardCardMetric`, since those
   render a large headline figure + caption meant for a dashboard card,
   not a compact inline stat under a phone field.

   Each slot is its own single-item `Accordion` (title = the slot label,
   e.g. "Home"/"Phone 2") — collapsible per request, `defaultValue={label}`
   so every slot still starts open (same "collapsible but open by default"
   convention as the Overview tab's own "Latest Interaction" accordion).
   `PhoneInput` no longer gets its own `label` prop: the accordion's own
   trigger already shows the slot name as its title immediately above the
   field, so a second, identical label directly under it was pure
   duplication (confirmed from a screenshot of the pre-accordion layout —
   "Home" as a plain heading, then "Home" again as the phone field's own
   label right below it).

   No divider of its own on this row — `Accordion`'s own per-item
   `border-b` (accordion.tsx, rendered after every item's content)
   supplies the hairline between consecutive slots; `CustomerDirectory
   TabContent` adds one `border-t` above the whole list of rows for the
   divider separating it from the Email/Consent block, rather than every
   row duplicating that same top border (which used to visually double up
   with the row-before's own bottom divider). */

   the top, then up to 10 phone slots (`CustomerDirectoryPhoneRow`),
   separated by a hairline divider between every section
   (`border-lyra-border-subtle`). The reference screenshot's own
   alternating shaded/unshaded rows were dropped on request — plain
   dividers only, no zebra striping.

   Reference screenshot's own field labels were all-caps ("EMAIL", "HOME") —
   same legacy-app-styling situation as the Detail tab's "CONTACT #" etc.
   (see `CustomerDetailTabContent`'s own doc comment and CONTRIBUTING.md
   §17): typed in normal case here and left to each field component's own
   built-in label typography, not forced uppercase via CSS.

   Only the "Home" row (the first phone slot) seeds from real data — the
   same `fields` "Phone #" this panel's Overview/Detail tabs already show
   (parsed back into a `PhoneValue` via `phoneValueFromDisplay`), with
   `consentCall`/`consentSms` defaulted true since it's the customer's
   already-established primary channel. "Phone 2" through "Phone 10" have

      {/* `h-full min-h-0` — unconditional, every tab, not just gated to
          Interactions. Two earlier attempts at giving Interactions its own
          independently-scrolling box (one gated to just this tab, one
          unconditional like this) both failed live — but the actual root
          cause turned out to be one level up, not here: `SidePanel`'s own
          pinned/docked branch (side-panel.tsx) was missing the `h-full`
          its unpinned/full-screen branch already had, so `PanelContent`
          above this wrapper never reliably had a DEFINITE height to give
          it in docked mode specifically (confirmed by the exact symptom
          reported: full-screen scrolled fine, docked didn't — full-screen
          reaches its height a completely different way, `position:
          absolute` against `Container`'s own unambiguous flex-grow height,
          which was never affected by the bug). With that fixed at its
          actual source, this wrapper's own `h-full` now resolves correctly
          again — every tab gets a real box matching `PanelContent`'s
          available height (harmless for Overview/Detail/etc., which just
          overflow it normally with no clipping, same as always), and the
          Interactions tab below gets a genuinely bounded box to build its
          own internal list-scroll + overlaying detail panel on top of. */}
      {/* No avatar/name/presence block here — the InteriorPanel's own
          header (`headerTitle="Customer Information"` +
          `headerSubhead="{name} · {id}"`) already shows the name, so a
          second name+avatar block right below it was redundant.

          No tabs here either anymore — they used to live at the top of
          this same scrolling body, pinned via a hand-rolled `sticky`
          wrapper (see the git history / CONTRIBUTING.md's "Composing
          panel body content" for the full story of why that was wrong:
          the surrounding scroll container's own scrollbar still ran
          alongside a merely-`sticky` row, and `TabList`'s "N More"
          overflow menu had its own separate bug where selecting a tab
          from it silently did nothing once the row collapsed, fixed in
          tabs.tsx). They now render inside the header itself via
          `SidePanel`'s `headerTabs` prop — see
          `CustomerInformationSidePanel` below, which owns the
          `activeTab` state both this body and that header tab row need
          and passes this component just the number.

          This field list and the Customer Overview/Latest Interaction/
          Latest Note block below it are now both explicitly gated to the
          Overview tab (`activeTab === ...indexOf("Overview")`) —
          previously only the accordions had that gate, so this list
          rendered on every tab, including the new Detail tab added below,
          which shows its own full editable version of the same fields
          (`CustomerDetailTabContent`) and would otherwise show them twice.

          Layout (per explicit follow-up request): Customer Overview is now
          its own full-width row on top; Latest Interaction and Latest Note
          share one `.lyra-card-split-wrap`/`.lyra-card-split` row below it
          (see lyra-tokens.css) — reusing the same family `DashboardCard`
          bodies already use for "a couple of regions side by side,
          stacking once the container's own width gets tight" rather than
          inventing a new one (its ≤480px threshold already fits here on
          both ends: this panel's normal resizable range, ~350–425px per
          `InteriorPanel`'s own min/max defaults, stays comfortably under
          it — single column, unchanged from before this existed — and
          `allowFullScreen`'d width is easily past it — side by side).
          (Earlier arrangement, superseded here: Latest Interaction paired
          with Customer Overview in the split row, Latest Note full-width
          below both — moved per this follow-up request so Latest
          Interaction sits directly left of Latest Note instead.)

          Top/bottom order (both row and stacked state) falls straight out
          of plain DOM order — flexbox doesn't reverse either axis without
          an explicit `row-reverse`/`column-reverse`, so whichever child
          comes FIRST in the JSX is the TOP block regardless of state here
          (Customer Overview, full width, has no row-state sibling to sit
          left/right of). `align-items: stretch` (the split family's own
          default) is harmless here specifically because `Accordion`'s own
          root has no `h-full`/`flex-1` of its own (accordion.tsx) — a
          stretched flex item just leaves invisible empty space below its
          natural-height content, not a visibly over-tall bordered box.

          Unlike `.lyra-container-grid`/`.lyra-form-grid`, `.lyra-card-
          split` does NOT put `flex: 1 1 0%` on its children automatically
          — that family's own two optional modifiers (`.lyra-card-split-
          fixed`, a deliberately fixed 12rem column; `.lyra-card-split-
          chart`, `flex: 1 1 0%` for the region beside it) exist precisely
          because its usual pairing is one fixed-width region next to one
          flexible one, not two equal columns. Left as plain children, the
          two `Accordion`s took their own natural content width instead,
          rendering visibly unequal (each has its own different content
          length). The `.lyra-card-split-even` modifier (lyra-tokens.css)
          on both fixes that, splitting the row evenly (and correctly
          resetting back to full-width at the stacked stage, same as
          `.lyra-container-grid`/`.lyra-form-grid`'s own children — see
          that modifier's own doc comment for why a bare `flex-1` utility
          class alone isn't enough here).

          Gap consistency (per explicit request — rows and columns both
          16px): the outer `flex flex-col gap-4` below already puts 16px
          between Customer Overview and the split row. `.lyra-card-split`'s
          own shared rule (lyra-tokens.css) defaults to `gap: 1.5rem`
          (24px) — correct for its other consumers, but inconsistent with
          this 16px if left alone. Overridden here via an inline `style`
          (not a Tailwind class) specifically because `.lyra-card-split`'s
          `gap` comes from a plain CSS class, not a Tailwind utility —
          `cn()`/`tailwind-merge` only dedupes genuine Tailwind utility
          conflicts, so a `gap-4` class alongside `lyra-card-split` would
          just tie in specificity with it and depend on stylesheet source
          order to win, the exact fragility CONTRIBUTING.md already warns
          about elsewhere in this file. An inline style has no such
          ambiguity — it always wins. Applies identically whether the row
          is side-by-side or (≤480px) stacked to a column, since inline
          styles aren't scoped to a breakpoint the way the shared class's
          own `@container` rule is — 16px either way, matching the 16px
          above it. */}

              resizable width (~325–425px) it stacks to a column (Customer
              Overview on top, matching the old top-to-bottom reading order),

                  item, open by default) rather than a plain static block,

                  Height-matching now goes BOTH ways, per explicit follow-up
                  request — this used to stay unconditionally `h-fit` (its
                  own natural content height, from `CUSTOMER_INFO_ACCORDION_
                  CLASSNAME`) on the assumption its own field list was
                  reliably the taller side, with only the stacked column on
                  the right ever growing to match it. That assumption broke
                  once "View All Interactions" made the right column taller
                  for some customers — so this now clears `h-fit` to
                  `h-auto` (via `customerOverviewOpen`, controlled the same
                  way `latestNoteOpen` is — see that state's own comment)
                  whenever it's open, letting the row's own default
                  `align-items: stretch` size it to match whichever side is
                  actually taller, same mechanism the stacked wrapper below
                  already relied on for the other direction. Stays `h-fit`
                  while collapsed (same reasoning `latestNoteOpen`'s own gate
                  documents) so collapsing this card doesn't leave it
                  stretched into a tall box with a dead gap below its closed

                  explicit request) — was side-by-side with it in its own
                  row below Customer Overview before; now the two share this
                  plain flex column instead, which is itself the second
                  (right) child of the Customer Overview split row above.
                  `lyra-card-split-even` goes on THIS wrapper (a direct
                  child of `.lyra-card-split`), not on the two Accordions
                  inside it — they're no longer direct children of the split
                  row themselves, just plain stacked flex-column children.

                  `align-items: stretch` (the split row's own default)
                  stretches this wrapper's HEIGHT to match the row's cross
                  size — since it has no explicit height of its own to opt
                  out with, unlike each side's own Accordion, which opts
                  BACK out to `h-fit` whenever collapsed (Customer Overview's
                  own `customerOverviewOpen`/Latest Note's own
                  `latestNoteOpen` gates — see each Accordion's own comment).
                  While open, the row's cross size is simply the max of the
                  two sides' natural content heights, and BOTH sides now grow
                  to match it (Customer Overview via the row's cross axis
                  directly, this wrapper's own stacked column via Latest
                  Note's `flex-1` below) — so whichever side is actually
                  taller for a given customer, the other one grows to match
                  it, not just one fixed "always taller" side. That alone
                  only gets the outer wrapper box to the right total height,
                  though — a plain `flex-col` of two natural-height
                  Accordions doesn't automatically grow its own children to
                  fill that extra space, so without more, the wrapper would
                  just end in blank unbordered space below Latest Note
                  instead of the two columns visually lining up (confirmed
                  live — this was the very next thing reported). Latest
                  Note's own `flex-1` (see that Accordion's own comment
                  below) is what actually closes that gap, growing ITS
                  bordered box to absorb the leftover height so the stack's
                  own bottom edge lines up with Customer Overview's — same
                  "stretch a card's own box to fill available height, even
                  past its natural content" mechanism this file's own

                    CONTRIBUTING.md §17 ("Field label casing") says not to
                    do ("don't add `text-transform`; type the label text
                    correctly to begin with"). Typing the string as
                    `"Latest Interaction"` (already correct Title Case) and
                    letting the shared component's own typography render it
                    is the fix, not restyling it further.

                    Content itself comes from `latestInteraction` (built by
                    `buildLatestInteraction`) rather than one fixed
                    placeholder blurb — see that function's own doc comment
                    for why (it used to be the exact same "Asked about
                    upgrading her plan..." summary for every customer,
                    gendered pronoun and all, regardless of who was actually
                    open).

                    Status used to render as its own pill `Badge` sitting to
                    the right of the timestamp line — reverted per explicit
                    request (a filled pill there read as too visually loud/
                    noticeable). Now a plain second line directly below the
                    timestamp: a small circle `Badge` dot (`shape="circle"
                    dot"`, colored via `statusVariant` the same semantic-role
                    vocabulary `ContactHistoryStatusVariant`/Contact
                    History's own status dots already use) plus the status
                    name as plain text next to it — quieter than a filled
                    pill, same "dot + label" idiom already established
                    elsewhere in this file. */}

                    that block's own comments for the container/collapsible
                    rationale — applies identically here), synthesized by
                    `buildLatestNote` the same deterministic-per-customer
                    way. No status `Badge` here — notes don't carry a
                    resolution status the way an interaction does — just the

                    `flex-1` (only while open — see `latestNoteOpen`) is
                    what actually makes the stacked column's own stretched
                    height (from the split row's `align-items: stretch`,
                    see the wrapper's own comment above) show up as a real,
                    visibly-taller bordered box instead of invisible space
                    below it — growing THIS card, specifically, rather than
                    Latest Interaction above it, so the trailing card in the
                    stack is the one that absorbs the leftover height,
                    matching Customer Overview's own bottom edge. `h-auto`
                    alongside it clears `CUSTOMER_INFO_ACCORDION_CLASSNAME`'s
                    own `h-fit` for the same reason it did on the two cards'
                    old side-by-side row (see that history for the full
                    "h-fit silently overriding stretch" explanation) — this
                    is a flex-COLUMN growing on the main axis (height) this
                    time rather than a flex-ROW stretching on the cross axis,
                    but an explicit `h-fit` risks the same kind of fight
                    with the flex algorithm either way, so it's cleared here
                    too rather than assumed harmless. */}

        // definite `h-full` chain above).

        //     needs to dock within THIS box specifically, not the whole
        //     app shell.
        //   - At this panel's normal docked/popover widths (well under
        //     `InteriorPanel`'s own 1024px `isNarrow` threshold), that
        //     panel renders via its absolute-overlay branch — floating on

        //     content-driven one) sized to the actual visible area instead
        //     of the full unscrolled list height — which is what was
        //     causing the reported "double scroll"/cut-off-with-room-to-
        //     spare symptoms: an absolutely-positioned `h-full` matching a
        //     content-driven ancestor's height is exactly as tall as ALL
        //     the (possibly very long) list content, not the viewport.
        //   - At real full-screen width (≥1024px, `allowFullScreen`'d),
        //     that same panel switches to its normal inline branch instead
        //     — and because THIS wrapper is a flex ROW (not a plain block),
        //     that inline panel sits beside `CustomerHistoryTabContent` as

/** Shows the exact same "Customer Information" content the real panel

 *  data and the same `CUSTOMER_PANEL_TABS` tab set, even the same
 *  Overview-tab `AIInput` footer — inside a `Popover` when the agent
 *  hovers the record header's toggle icon while the real panel is closed
 *  (see the render site further down). A hover-preview flyout of the panel
 *  itself, per explicit request, not a separate hand-built summary — this
 *  can never show something different from what actually opening the panel
 *  would. Same idea as `InteractionNavItem`'s own compact-rail hover
 *  preview (interaction-nav-item.tsx: "think of how you display your left
 *  nav when it's closed"), which shows that card's full real content
 *  (`cardBody`) inside a bare, self-chromed `Popover` rather than a
 *  simplified stand-in — this component supplies that same complete chrome
 *  itself (border/background/shadow/rounded corners, matching `SidePanel`'s
 *  own `bg-lyra-bg-surface-container-subtle` — side-panel.tsx) since the
 *  render site strips the default `Popover` framing to a bare frame around
 *  it, exactly like that same precedent.
 *
 *  Sized to actually fit as a flyout (fixed `w-[340px]`, matching this
 *  panel's own default docked width, `max-h-[70vh]` with only the body
 *  scrolling) rather than the real panel's full docked/full-screen height —
 *  the header (title/subhead + tabs) stays pinned via `PanelHeader`'s own
 *  `tabs` prop, same fixed-header/scrolling-body split `SidePanel` itself
 *  uses, so a tall tab's content scrolls internally instead of pushing the
 *  popover off-screen. Owns its own `activeTab` state (starts on Overview),
 *  independent of the real panel's own — switching tabs in this preview
 *  doesn't affect, and isn't affected by, whatever tab the agent last left
 *  the real panel on.
 *
 *  `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` are wired by the caller to the exact same
 *  open-immediately/close-on-a-short-delay handlers as the trigger icon
 *  itself — Radix `Popover.Content` portals straight to `document.body`,
 *  outside the trigger icon's own DOM subtree, so without re-arming here
 *  too, moving the pointer from the icon into this (portaled) popover would
 *  fire the icon's own `onMouseLeave` and close the preview before the
 *  agent can actually read it — same fix already applied once for
 *  `InteractionNavItem`'s own hover-preview card. */

/* ── CustomerInformationSidePanel ──
   Owns `activeTab` — the one piece of state both the header's `TabList`
   (via `SidePanel`'s `headerTabs`) and the scrolling body below it
   (`CustomerInformationPanelBody`) need, which is why this wraps both
   instead of `CustomerInformationPanelBody` owning that state itself the
   way it used to when the tabs still lived inside it.

   Also where the field list and Latest Interaction summary are actually
   computed (`buildCustomerInfoFields`/`buildLatestInteraction`, each
   memoized on `customerName`/`recordId`/`channels`) — takes the raw
   interaction fields instead of a pre-joined `headerSubhead` string so it
   has what it needs to build the header text and both panel-body pieces
   from the same source, rather than the caller assembling one string this
   component has to parse back apart.

   Docked via the generic `SidePanel` primitive (originally LEFT, matching
   an early reference screenshot; now RIGHT — `side="right"` below — per a
   later explicit request to move it, alongside the render site's own move
   to the row's other end) rather than the right-docked `InteriorPanel` this
   was previously built on — pin/hover-preview state lives in the parent
   (mirrors `AgentNextGenTemplate.stories.tsx`'s own `CustomerInformation-
   Panel` usage), since that's a `SidePanel`-only concept `InteriorPanel`
   never had. `allowFullScreen`/`exitFullScreenSignal`/`onOverlayModeChange`
   don't carry over — `SidePanel` has no "full screen" or "floating
   overlay" concept of its own; an unpinned panel simply shows/hides on
   hover instead.

   Full-screen (per explicit follow-up request) is built entirely here,
   without adding a real "full screen" concept to `SidePanel` itself: the
   caller passes `pinned={false}` (always an unpinned/floating overlay
   while full-screen — pushing the main column over via docked/pinned mode
   wouldn't read as "overlay full screen within its parent container") and
   `width` equal to the parent `Container`'s own measured width
   (`sidePanelContainerWidth`, already tracked for the narrow-container
   guard) instead of the normal drag-resized width, so the panel's own
   existing unpinned/absolute rendering branch (side-panel.tsx) covers the
   whole container edge to edge — animated by the same CSS width
   transition every other resize already uses, so expanding/collapsing
   full-screen isn't an instant jump cut. That animation needed one small
   fix in the shared `usePanelDragResize` hook (use-panel-drag-resize.ts):
   it used to latch onto whatever width a manual drag last set and ignore
   further external `width` prop changes afterward, which (a) silently
   broke this full-screen toggle for a panel that had been manually
   resized even once before, and (b) meant this component used to have to
   force a full remount on every full-screen toggle just to reset that
   stale internal state, which skipped the transition entirely (a fresh
   DOM node has no prior frame to animate from). The hook now resets its
   own internal drag state whenever its `initialWidth` prop changes, so it
   stays properly reactive to external width changes and no remount is
   needed here anymore. */

// on-screen size at minimum, not just the same raw CSS number. The two
// consumers read this differently because only ONE of them pays a padding
// tax on the way there (see `INTERACTION_MAIN_CONTENT_MIN_WIDTH`, just below,
// for why): the docked panel's own outer box has no padding of its own, so it
// passes this value straight through as its literal `minWidth` prop; the main
// content column needs to add its own padding back on top (that's exactly
// what `INTERACTION_MAIN_CONTENT_MIN_WIDTH` is for).
const SHARED_CONTENT_MIN_VISUAL_WIDTH = 362;

// The interaction record's own main content column (record-header tab row +
// transcript + composer, `containerRef`'s div) — never renders narrower
// than this, even with a docked shared panel (Notifications/AI/Apps/etc.)
// open and LeftNav expanded. Below this, the record-header tab's own
// address/name label, the transcript bubbles, and the composer all started
// cramping/wrapping (confirmed live — the exact report that prompted this
// constant). Paired with `dockedPanelRenderWidth`'s own clamp (this docked
// panel's own render block, further down) rather than left as a plain CSS
// `min-w-[…]` floor on its own: a bare CSS floor with nothing else giving up
// space just pushes the WHOLE row past the viewport once every sibling's
// combined width exceeds what's actually available (confirmed live as an
// earlier, simpler attempt's actual failure mode) — the docked panel has to
// be the one that shrinks to make room, since it's the only sibling here
// with a size that's a preference (a drag-resized width) rather than a
// genuine floor of its own.
//
// `containerRef`'s own div is `border-box` sized (Tailwind's preflight
// default), so its `pr-3` (12px) right padding is CARVED OUT of a plain
// `min-w-[350px]` rather than added on top of it, leaving only 338px of
// actual usable content width for the record-header row/transcript/composer
// inside — confirmed live as the reason the row was still measurably
// narrower than intended even though the floor was technically "holding" at
// 350. This is `SHARED_CONTENT_MIN_VISUAL_WIDTH` (the real, usable-content
// target both this column and the docked panel should match) + 12 (this same
// `pr-3`), so the CONTENT area itself — not the padded border-box — never
// drops below `SHARED_CONTENT_MIN_VISUAL_WIDTH`. The docked panel does NOT
// need this same `+ 12` treatment — its own outer box carries no equivalent
// padding, so `SHARED_CONTENT_MIN_VISUAL_WIDTH` alone already lands it at the
// same real visual width as this column's floor.
//
// Two call sites read this: the plain CSS floor itself is a literal
// `min-w-[374px]` on `containerRef`'s own div (Tailwind's arbitrary-value
// classes need a literal string at build time, same reason
// `CUSTOMER_INFO_COLUMN_MINWIDTHS` above pairs each column's own
// `min-w-[…]` string with a plain numeric `minWidthPx` for JS math) — keep

  /* Per-assignment memory for the Customer Information panel's open/closed
     and full-screen state — per explicit request: switching between two
     already-active assignments (e.g. clicking a different LeftNav
     assignment card) must not let one assignment's full-screen/closed
     choice leak onto another. Closing the panel on assignment A and
     leaving it full-screen on assignment B, then switching back to A,
     should show A closed again — not full-screen just because that's
     wherever the shared `sidePanelOpen`/`sidePanelFullScreen` state
     happened to land last.

     Deliberately a small helper called from every place `activeInteractionId`
     changes, rather than a `useEffect` keyed on it (the "effect instead of
     touching every call site" pattern this file otherwise prefers — see
     `panelFullScreen`'s own reset effect above). An effect can't do this
     correctly here: several of the switch call sites below also set
     `sidePanelOpen` themselves (their own `isNewInteraction` branches) in
     the SAME batch as `setActiveInteractionId`. React applies every
     setState in that batch together in one render, so by the time any
     effect watching `activeInteractionId` could run, `sidePanelOpen`
     already reflects the NEW assignment's value — there's no render left
     in which the OUTGOING assignment's actual value is still visible to
     read. This helper instead reads `sidePanelOpen`/`sidePanelFullScreen`
     synchronously, via plain closure, at the moment it's called — BEFORE
     any state update from this switch has been applied — which is exactly
     the outgoing assignment's real last value every time.

     Only covers open/full-screen, per explicit request — `sidePanelPinned`/
     `sidePanelWidth` stay shared across assignments (read more like a
     general layout preference than something tied to one specific
     assignment, and weren't asked for); extend the same way if that's ever
     requested too.

     A never-before-seen assignment id (no snapshot yet) always gets
     `fullScreen: false` — a fresh assignment should never silently inherit
     full-screen from whatever was active before — but `sidePanelOpen` is
     deliberately left untouched here: each "new interaction" call site
     below already decides that correctly via `lastSidePanelOpenChoice`
     right after calling this, and re-deciding it here too would just be a
     second, competing source of truth for the same value.

     Restoring a different assignment's own open/full-screen values here
     used to still visibly play `SidePanel`'s own width/opacity transitions
     (side-panel.tsx — `transition: "width 250ms cubic-bezier(...)"` on
     open/close, `"opacity 150ms ease 30ms"` on its inner content) exactly
     as if the agent had just clicked the toggle themselves — switching TO
     an assignment whose panel happens to be closed (or full-screen)
     visibly slid the panel shut (or expanded it) on every single switch,
     read as "disorienting" per explicit report, since none of that was an
     actual open/close ACTION, just this assignment's panel already having
     been left that way. A first attempt suppressed that transition
     outright (a `!important` CSS class toggled on briefly via this
     helper), which fixed the sliding but traded it for a different
     problem, also reported live: the panel then just snapped into view
     with no animation at all, while the content column beside it (see
     `key={`interaction-${activeInteraction.id}`}` below) was still doing
     its own soft `animate-in fade-in-0` — the panel read as "not fading,
     just appearing," out of sync with everything else on the same switch.

     Fixed properly at the render site instead (not here): the panel is
     now wrapped in a `key`ed div using `activeInteraction.id`, the exact
     same "force a full remount on every genuine switch" technique the
     content column already uses for its own fade-in — see that div's own
     doc comment further down for why this solves BOTH problems at once
     without any transition-suppression trickery. This helper's own job
     stays exactly what it says above: decide WHAT `sidePanelOpen`/
     `sidePanelFullScreen` should be for the incoming assignment, not HOW

  /* "Redial" from the home tab's Contact History card — same merge-by-id
     pattern as `handleQuickDial` (a fresh "voice" channel, keyed so redialing
     the same past contact again restarts their existing card instead of
     stacking a duplicate), but keyed off that contact-history entry's own id
     (namespaced "redial:" to stay distinct from quick-dial/outbound ids) and
     carrying the customer's real name, since — unlike a quick-dialed number —
     Contact History always has one on hand. Also expands the nav, same
     reasoning as handleStartCall/handleQuickDial above.

     Prefers `entry.customerId` (the real `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` id) over the
     synthetic `redial:` one whenever it's on hand — this was a real, shipped
     bug: `useOutboundAddButton`'s `getHeaderAction` looks up an interaction's
     own id in `outboundConfig.groups` to build its "+" (Add Channel) button.
     A synthetic `redial:ch1`-style id never matches any real contact, so
     `getHeaderAction` now returns `null` for it (no button at all) rather
     than one that renders but silently does nothing once picked — see
     `getHeaderAction`'s own doc comment in create-new.tsx. Using the real id
     makes a redialed card id-identical to one started from the Outbound
     picker for the same customer, so "Add Channel" (and, as a side effect,
     redialing the same customer who already has a card open elsewhere) both
     resolve correctly. Only the 5 hand-authored `CONTACT_HISTORY` rows
     (fictional names/case IDs, no backing `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` record)
     still fall back to the synthetic id, and so get no "+" button — same

   *  hardcoded default status for that session. This is independent of
   *  `closed` above: a row can be reopened at, say, "Escalated" and still be

  /* ── Preventing duplicate channels from the CreateNew picker ──
     A contact already reachable via a currently-open channel (e.g. Jamie
     Torres has an SMS interaction open on a specific number) still shows
     that channel in "Select Channel" and every address in the detail
     screen's second field ("Select Phone"/"Select Email Address"/"Select
     WhatsApp Handle") — except whichever exact address(es) are already in
     use, which are disabled so starting another interaction on one of them
     wouldn't just duplicate the one already running (a different outbound
     line for the same channel — or a second, still-unused one, even when
     one SMS number is already open — stays selectable). Voice is the one
     exception to "disable by address, not by channel" — see
     `openChannelTypes`/`isChannelBlockedForContact`'s own doc comments
     (create-new.tsx) for why a call has no per-address concept to key off
     of at all.
     `CreateNewOutboundContact.openChannelAddresses`/`openChannelTypes` are
     exactly the mechanisms `CreateNew` exposes for this (see each one's own

     component, this derives a per-render copy of OUTBOUND_CONFIG that tags
     each contact with every address in use (`openChannelAddresses`) AND
     every channel *type* currently open regardless of address
     (`openChannelTypes`) for whichever channels they already have open in
     `interactions` (read off each `TrackedChannel.type`/`.value`, set at
     start-call time — a contact can have more than one channel of the same
     type open at once, e.g. two SMS threads on different numbers, so
     addresses are a list per channel type, not a single value), across
     every group (Agents/Teams/Skills/Customers — Favorites is derived from
     these same records, so it inherits the tagging automatically).

     a real assignment card in the LeftNav, same merge-by-id + "expand the
     nav, open the Customer Information panel" pattern `handleQuickDial`/
     `handleRedial` already use. Channel comes from `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL`

     than a field on `AgentNotification` itself.

     from the notification's own id (`Number(notification.id) % ...length`,
     not random, so re-clicking the same notification always resolves to the
     same card) — rather than a synthetic `notif:${id}` one. This is the
     exact same case `handleRedial`'s own doc comment above describes:
     `useOutboundAddButton`'s `getHeaderAction` looks up an interaction's id
     in `outboundConfig.groups` to resolve its "+" Add Channel button — a
     synthetic id never matches, so `getHeaderAction` returns no button at
     all for it. Using a real customer id here means notification-opened
     assignments get a working Add Channel button just like any other
     assignment, while still displaying the notification's own name

  // a time, always starting with the FARTHEST LEFT pinned one in the
  // *current* (user-reorderable) `panelOrder` — since that's the icon
  // nearest `AppName` and the first to collide with it as space runs out,
  // dragging a button further right also moves it further down the "gets
  // hidden first" list. A dropped button isn't gone — same as unpinning it,
  // it just stops rendering in the header and stays reachable via "View All
  // Apps" (`appsMenuItems` above lists every key regardless of pinned/
  // responsively-hidden state).
  //
  // This used to be a table of fixed viewport-width breakpoints, which
  // hid icons well before they actually needed the room (lots of dead space
  // between `AppName` and the icons at widths that were already hiding
  // several of them) and didn't account for anything BUT window width
  // (e.g. a wider/narrower `AppName` — it hardcodes "Agent Next Gen" today,
  // but AppMenu/AppName are generic). Replaced with real geometry: measure
  // the actual gap between `AppName`'s rendered right edge
  // (`appNameMeasureRef`) and the visible icon row's rendered left edge
  // (`headerIconsMeasureRef`) after every layout, and only hide/reveal a
  // icon when that gap actually crosses a threshold — i.e. when they're
  // genuinely about to collide, not on a width guess. A small hysteresis
  // gap (`SHOW_GAP_PX` well above `HIDE_GAP_PX`) keeps this from
  // flapping — hiding an icon frees up roughly one icon's width of gap,
  // which would otherwise immediately clear the "show one back" threshold

  // containing block for an absolutely positioned element is its
  // ancestor's PADDING box, so `right-0`/`bottom-0` would land flush with
  // containerRef's true outer edge, swallowing its own `pr-3 pb-3` (the

  // where the docked panel's own right/bottom edges would sit — flush only
  // on top/left, matching the docked panel's own flush-top/flush-left
  // look. `rounded-lyra-lg border ... overflow-hidden` also matches
  // `sharedPanel`'s own docked-variant styling (and `Draggable`'s own
  // docked-branch wrapper, which always applies `overflow-hidden` — see
  // draggable.tsx) rather than the previous full-bleed/borderless look.
  // `z-[9]` sits above the Customer Information panel's `z-[5]` but

  // (`z-10`, left-nav.tsx) — that button is positioned `absolute -right-3`
  // (poking ~12px past LeftNav's own right edge, i.e. spatially into

  // establish its own stacking context (no z-index of its own), so a
  // descendant's z-index here competes directly against LeftNav's
  // sibling-level z-10, not just against other things inside `containerRef`
  // — going any higher (e.g. the `z-[50]` this used originally) paints
  // over/hides that toggle button, per explicit follow-up request to keep
  // it clickable/visible instead. Doesn't need to compete with the
  // app-header's own menus (`z-[9999]`) — those live in a different row
  // entirely (above `containerRef`, not inside it).
  // Mounted on `fullScreenRendered` (which outlives `panelFullScreen` by
  // 180ms on the way out — see that state's own doc comment) rather than
  // `panelFullScreen` directly, so the fade/scale-out transition below
  // actually gets to play instead of the overlay just disappearing the
  // instant fullscreen is exited. The transition itself keys off
  // `fullScreenVisible`, NOT `panelFullScreen` directly — see that
  // state's own doc comment for why a freshly-mounted node needs a
  // separate "hidden first, visible one frame later" flag to actually
  // animate in, rather than just popping straight to its final opacity/
  // scale with nothing to transition from. CSS transition (not a
  // keyframe animation) per the same reasoning as the float/docked panels
  // just below — avoids compositor fill-mode flash. `scale`'s default
  // center origin reads fine here since this overlay already fills the
  // whole container; a corner-anchored origin would need `transformOrigin`

                Agent Chat / Schedule / Notifications / Ask AI — all ten
                now go through lyra-ui's `ActionIconButton` (`size="xl"`,
                44px), the single canonical AppHeader icon-button shape.
                These used to be hand-rolled `<button>`s (`h-10 w-10
                rounded-lyra-lg`) matching `NotificationsBell`'s own
                trigger, which at the time was also hand-rolled rather than
                built on `ActionIconButton` — lyra-ui has since consolidated
                `NotificationsBell` and `ActionIconButton` onto one shared
                implementation (composing `Button` internally), with
                44px/`rounded-lyra-sm` as the confirmed canonical AppHeader
                size, so this row now matches `Header.tsx`'s (and lyra-ui's
                own `AppHeader.stories.tsx`) icon buttons instead of
                diverging from them. Labeled "Agent Chat" — renamed from
                "Conversations" (itself previously renamed from "Messages"),
                per explicit request tying it to the same click behavior
                Sarah Miller's "New Agent Chat" notification now switches to
                (see `onNotificationClick`'s own doc comment above) — same
                trigger/panel throughout, just the label. Screen Pop sits to
                the left of Agent Chat, using lucide's `MonitorUp` (monitor +
                up arrow) to match the requested icon exactly.

                Search/Customers/Accounts/Tickets/WEM all share the exact
                same single-container panel every other button here does
                (see `handlePanelButtonClick`/`contentByPanelKey` above) —
                each just shows its own blank placeholder body (Search gets
                a `SearchInput` in `headerContent` too, same "fixed above
                the divider" treatment Screen Pop's app-select uses), no
                bespoke content yet since none of the five has a real data
                source in this prototype. WEM = Workforce Engagement
                Management — `Gauge` (already used elsewhere on the Desk
                dashboard for a performance metric) reused here since it's
                the closest existing icon to "workforce performance/
                engagement" rather than importing a near-duplicate.

                Trailing "View All Apps" kebab (after Notifications, before
                the AgentProfile divider) lists all nine of these (via
                `appsMenuItems`, built above from `PANEL_KEY_METADATA`) with
                a pin toggle per row — unpinning one wraps its button above
                in `{showHeaderIcon("KEY") && ...}` (`pinnedKeys[key] &&
                !responsivelyHiddenKeys.has(key)`, see the "Responsive
                header icon collapse" block above), hiding the persistent
                header icon while leaving the app reachable from this menu
                (its `onClick` is the same `handlePanelButtonClick` the
                header icon itself uses). That same `showHeaderIcon` check
                is also what auto-hides pinned buttons left-to-right as the
                viewport narrows, so a small screen doesn't squish
                `AppName`. `KebabMenuButton` (not the hand-rolled
                `Menu`) because its rows render as Radix `<div
                role="menuitem">`s rather than `<button>`s — required here
                since each row nests a real `<button>` (`PanelPinButton`) in
                `rightElement`, which would be invalid HTML nested inside
                another button. Wrapped in `Tooltip`+`span` because
                `KebabMenuButton` doesn't spread arbitrary props onto its
                inner trigger, so `Tooltip`'s `asChild` cloning needs that
                intermediate span to attach its hover handlers (same fix
                already used for the "More options" overflow menu in
                lyra-ui's own agent-notifications.tsx). Sized up from its
                24px default to the 44px `ActionIconButton` standard via
                `className` (twMerge dedupes the conflicting h-6/w-6). Uses
                `align="right"` (its default) here since it now sits at the
                right end of the row, matching every other right-aligned
                overflow kebab in this file. */}
            {/* Search through Notifications used to be nine near-identical
                hand-written blocks (one per key); collapsed into a single
                `.map()` over the live, reorderable `panelOrder` (filtered to
                whichever are currently pinned-and-visible via
                `showHeaderIcon`) so drag-to-reorder only has to be wired up
                once. Each icon is wrapped in a plain draggable `<div>`
                rather than teaching `ActionIconButton`/`NotificationsBell`
                themselves about native HTML5 drag — same
                `panelDragHandlers`/`panelDragOverKey` the "View All Apps"
                menu rows below use, so dragging an icon here to reorder it
                moves the very same `panelOrder` array those rows read (and
                a drag in the menu reorders the header right back), rather
                than two independently-drifting orders. "notif" still
                renders the specialized `NotificationsBell` (badge count,
                its own `open`/`onOpenChange`) instead of a generic
                `ActionIconButton` — everything else comes straight out of
                `PANEL_KEY_METADATA`. `headerIconsMeasureRef` wraps just
                this visible row (not the kebab/separator/profile after it)
                — its rendered LEFT edge is the other half of the "Responsive

                        header — with an "Active"/"Closed" status badge
                        alongside, mirroring `activeInteraction.closed`.

                        `actions` holds the header-level buttons, per
                        explicit request: at full width, one small outline
                        icon button PER channel this contact can still add
                        (Call/Email/SMS/…, via `getAvailableChannels` below)
                        instead of a single combined "Add Channel" trigger —
                        each one is still the exact same `OutboundAddButton`
                        every other "+" in this app uses (`getHeaderAction`,
                        create-new.tsx), just locked to one channel via its
                        new `initialChannel` option (skips straight to the
                        phone/skill picker, no redundant "Select Channel"
                        step) and wearing that channel's own icon via
                        `icon` instead of the default "+". Below the
                        `recordHeaderWidth < 768` breakpoint, this whole row
                        collapses down to the single combined "+" trigger
                        instead (the original, unrestricted `getHeaderAction`
                        call — every channel back in one "Select Channel"
                        picker) — there isn't room for one button per
                        channel once the header itself gets this tight.
                        Customer Information is deliberately LAST in
                        `actions` — a plain flex row, so whichever child
                        renders last just naturally lands at the far right
                        of it, no extra positioning prop needed.

                        Customer Information collapses to icon-only at the
                        SAME `recordHeaderWidth < 768` breakpoint (per
                        explicit follow-up request) — drops its "Customer
                        Information" label down to a bare id-card glyph
                        exactly when the channel buttons above collapse to
                        their own single icon trigger, so the whole row
                        changes shape together instead of one side
                        collapsing before the other.

                        being a safe stand-in for it once this button

                  desk-tab switches (never unmounted by the `hidden` toggle
                  below) so `CustomersListView`'s own search/sort/filters/
                  added-filter-keys/visible-columns/pagination/row-selection
                  state all survive navigating away to another tab and back
                  — a plain `cond ? <CustomersListView/> : ...` would remount
                  it fresh (and lose every one of those) each time.

                  Both now live together in ONE real box (`flex flex-1
                  overflow-hidden`, not `display:contents`) that toggles
                  `hidden` as a whole, rather than each having its own
                  separate visibility mechanism the way this used to be
                  split (`CustomersListView` behind a `contents`/`hidden`
                  wrapper, `CustomerRowInfoPanel` driven by nulling its own
                  `row` prop instead). That split was the actual cause of a
                  reported bug: nulling `row` on tab-switch didn't hide the
                  panel — it told `InteriorPanel` to CLOSE, which plays its
                  own 250ms width-close transition. Because the panel was a
                  real flex sibling of whatever the newly-selected tab was
                  about to show, that 250ms of shrinking width visibly
                  reflowed the new tab's content growing to fill the space
                  beside it — the "dashboard animating its position" bug.
                  Removing it from layout instantly (rather than animating
                  the panel closed) is what fixes the reported reflow — the
                  panel's own real open/close animation still plays normally
                  for actual same-tab closes (its header's × button, or
                  `onRowClick` picking a different row); only navigating AWAY
                  from this tab skips it.

                  `display:none` (Tailwind's `hidden`) was the first attempt
                  here, but it caused a SECOND, subtler bug on the way BACK
                  in: `InteriorPanel` (inside `CustomerRowInfoPanel`) tracks
                  its own real DOM parent's width via `ResizeObserver` to
                  decide whether to auto-full-screen below 768px (see that
                  component's own doc comment) — and `display:none` elements
                  report a genuine 0×0 size to `ResizeObserver`, not just a
                  stale old value. So the instant this wrapper went
                  `display:none`, the observer fired with width 0, and that
                  0 lingered as `InteriorPanel`'s last-known parent width
                  until a NEW (necessarily asynchronous — `ResizeObserver`
                  callbacks never run synchronously with the style change
                  that caused them) callback caught up with the real width
                  after switching back. For that one frame, `parentWidth`
                  read as 0 (well under both the 1024px/768px thresholds),
                  so `InteriorPanel` briefly rendered its full-screen/
                  absolute-overlay layout before correcting itself back to
                  its normal ~350-425px docked width and position — visible
                  as the panel sliding in from full width, the left-to-right
                  animation reported after this fix's first pass.

                  `visibility:hidden` (`invisible`) + `position:absolute
                  inset-0` was the SECOND attempt, replacing `display:none` —
                  it still generates a real box with a real, stable size for
                  `ResizeObserver`, fixing the bug above. But it introduced a
                  THIRD bug: `visibility` is inherited but overridable by a
                  descendant that sets its own explicit value — and
                  `InteriorPanel`'s inner content div does exactly that
                  (`style={{ visibility: open ? "visible" : "hidden" }}`,
                  interior-panel.tsx), keyed off its OWN `open` prop, which is
                  `row !== null` — true regardless of which desk tab is
                  active, since `row` is just `selectedCustomerRow` now, not
                  gated on `activeDeskTab` (see the render call site below).
                  So `invisible` on this wrapper got silently overridden back
                  to visible one level down, and — still `position:absolute`,
                  so no longer competing for flex space either — the panel
                  rendered floating on top of whatever tab WAS actually
                  active, confirmed from a screenshot showing it overlapping
                  the Dashboard.

                  `opacity-0` (this wrapper) + `inert` (native HTML attribute,
                  supported as a real prop since React 19 — see this file's
                  own React version) is the fix that actually holds up:
                  unlike `visibility`, `opacity` composites the WHOLE
                  subtree as one flattened layer, so a descendant's own
                  inline `opacity`/`visibility` can't punch back through a
                  `0`-opacity ancestor the way it could with `visibility`
                  alone. `inert` (not just `pointer-events-none`) additionally
                  drops the entire subtree out of tab order and the
                  accessibility tree and blocks ALL interaction, not only
                  pointer events — the same "fully inactive but still really
                  there, still correctly sized" result `visibility:hidden`
                  was reaching for, just via a property children genuinely
                  cannot override. */}

            blocks (one per panel); with only one physical container now,
            there's only one. Skipped in `isCombinedPanelMode` — below
            768px the panel's content renders inline as the main
            container's second tab instead (see above), not as this
            separate docked-width column beside it. Also skipped while
            `panelFullScreen` is on — `sharedPanelFullScreenOverlay` (an
            `absolute inset-0` overlay rendered as `containerRef`'s own last
            child, just above) takes over instead.

            `dockedPanelRenderWidth` (below), not the raw `panelWidth`
            state, drives this block's own two `width` styles —
            `maxDockedWidthForMainFloor` (computed once, alongside
            `sharedPanel` above, so `Draggable`'s own `maxWidth` prop there
            can use the exact same boundary) is `containerRef`'s own
            `min-w-[374px]` floor's other half: without SOMETHING here
            actively shrinking to make room, that floor has nowhere to
            borrow space from on its own — once this panel's width plus
            that floor plus LeftNav's own width exceed what
            `bodyContainerWidth` actually has, plain CSS has no way to
            shrink one flex sibling to free up room for another's min-width,
            so the ROW just grows past the viewport instead (confirmed live
            as the actual failure mode of an earlier, simpler attempt at
            this same min-width — and, separately, of an even earlier
            version of THIS fix that only capped the render width while
            NOT actively dragging, which still let a live drag visually run
            the panel off the right edge of the screen; feeding the same
            boundary into `Draggable`'s own `maxWidth` above closes that
            gap too, so this now applies unconditionally, drag or not).
            `panelWidth` itself (the drag-resized value `Draggable`'s own
            `onWidthChange` writes) is left untouched everywhere else —
            float-mode sizing, `Draggable`'s own `defaultWidth`, the

      {/* ── Welcome modal — shown once on page load. Uses the real lyra-ui
          `Modal` component (variant="light": frosted blur backdrop,
          portal-rendered via Radix Dialog, focus-trapped) rather than a
          hand-rolled backdrop div, so it actually dims/blurs the dashboard
          behind it like a real overlay instead of just painting over it.
          Not dismissible via backdrop click or Escape — only the two
          buttons close it. Previously composed by hand as `Overlay` +
          `AgentWelcomeMessage` (which itself rendered its own
          `Container variant="modal"` shell) — `Modal` now owns that
          Radix Dialog wiring directly, so `AgentWelcomeMessage` is passed
          `bare` to skip its own card chrome and avoid nesting two.

          `Modal`'s "light" variant is a fixed `bg-white/70` by design (see
          Overlay.stories.tsx — "light" vs. "dark" are two deliberately
          static, theme-independent overlay looks, not meant to react to
          dark mode). This page's backdrop needs to actually match the
          current theme, so we override just the background color via
          `overlayClassName` (twMerge drops the variant's `bg-white/70` for
          this `bg-[color-mix(...)]`, keeping `backdrop-blur-sm`). We use
          color-mix() instead of a plain `bg-lyra-bg-surface-shell/70`
          opacity modifier because Tailwind can't generate opacity-modified
          utilities for our `var(--lyra-color-*)` tokens (same root cause as
          the Tag border-color bug — see lyra-ui's PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).

          The card itself is still the shared `AgentWelcomeMessage` lyra-ui
          component (icon/title/lastLogin block + info-box slot + Separator +
          two-button footer) — `ariaTitle` gives screen readers the real
          dialog name since that title now renders inside `AgentWelcomeMessage`
          itself rather than through `Modal`'s own `headerTitle`. ── */}

            that slot (and the Separator above the footer that goes with
            it) when `children` is actually passed, so simply omitting it
            here removes the box cleanly rather than rendering it empty.
            The numbers it used to show (`AGENT_SKILLS_COUNT`/
            `TEAMMATES_ONLINE_COUNT`/`TEAMMATES_AVAILABLE_COUNT`) are still
            defined/unused above — left in place to restore this easily

          Resolution change) — kept at the very end of this tree, a sibling
          of everything else, same as `Modal` above, so it's always mounted
          regardless of which desk tab/panel is currently active.

          Wrapping `<div>` takes over the `fixed bottom-4 right-4`
          positioning `ToastContainer` normally owns itself (overridden
          below via its own `className` — `cn`'s `tailwind-merge` cleanly
          drops the conflicting defaults rather than fighting them) so the
          "Dismiss All" chip can sit as a normal flex sibling ABOVE the
          toast stack, per explicit request, rather than needing a second,
          separately-measured `fixed` element trying to track the first
          toast's ever-changing position by hand. */}
